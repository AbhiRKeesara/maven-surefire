Defining a POJO Test

  POJO tests look very much like JUnit or TestNG tests, though they do not
  require dependencies on these artifacts.  A test class should be named
  <<<**/*Test>>> and should contain <<<test*>>> methods which will each be 
  executed by surefire.  
  
  Validating assertions can be done using the JDK 1.4 <<<assert>>> keyword.
  Simultaneous test execution is not possible with POJO tests.
  
  Fixture can be setup before and after each <<<test*>>> method by implementing
  a set-up and a tear-down method.  These methods must match these signatures 
  to be recognized and executed before and after each test method.

public void setUp();
public void tearDown();

  These fixture methods can also throw any exception and will still be valid.
