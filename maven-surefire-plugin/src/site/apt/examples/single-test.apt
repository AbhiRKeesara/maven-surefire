Running a Single Test

  During development, you may run a single test class repeatedly. To run this
  through Maven, set the <<<test>>> property to a specific test case.

+---+
mvn -Dtest=TestCircle test
+---+

  The value for the <<<test>>> parameter is the name of the test class (without the extension; we'll strip off the extension if you accidentally provide one).

  You may also use patterns to run a number of tests:

+---+
mvn -Dtest=TestCi*le test
+---+

  And you may use multiple names/patterns, separated by commas:

+---+
mvn -Dtest=TestSquare,TestCi*le test
+---+

Running a set of methods in a Single Test Class

  With version 2.7.3, you can run only n tests in a single Test Class.
  
  << NOTE : it's supported for junit 4.x and TestNG. >>
  
  You must use the following syntax
  
+---+
mvn -Dtest=TestCircle#mytest test
+---+

  You can use patterns too
  
+---+
mvn -Dtest=TestCircle#*test* test
+---+
