Using Junit

* Configuring Junit

  To get started with junit, you need to add the required version of junit to your project:

+---+
  [...]
    <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <version>4.8.1</version>
      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
  [...]
+---+


  This is the only step that is required to get started - you can now create tests in your test source directory
  (eg, <<<src/test/java>>>.

* Generations of junit support

  Surefire supports three different generations of junit: Junit3.8.x, Junit 4.x (serial provider) and Junit 4.7 (junitcore provider
   with parallel support). The provider is selected based on the junit version in your project and the configuration parameters (for parallel).

* Running tests in parallel

  From junit 4.7 and onwards you can run your tests in parallel. To do this, you must set the
  <<<parallel>>> parameter, and may change the <<<threadCount>>> or <<<useUnlimitedThreads>>> attribute.
  For example:

+---+
    [...]
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <parallel>methods</parallel>
          <threadCount>10</threadCount>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    [...]
+---+

* Using Junit core provider

  If your tests specify any value for the "parallel" attribute and your project uses junit4.7+, your request will be routed to
  the concurrent junit provider, which uses the JUnit JUnitCore testrunner.

  This is particularly useful for slow tests that can have high concurrency, or to quickly and roughly assess the independance
  and thread safety of your tests and code.

  The JUnitCore test-runner has stricter test-compliance checking than earlier versions of junit; with this provider
  your test must be legitimate junit tests to be run, whereas the old 4.x provider would also run tests that were not according to
  junit spec.
