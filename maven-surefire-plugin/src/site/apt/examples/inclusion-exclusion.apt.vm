Inclusions and Exclusions of Tests

* Inclusions

  By default, the Surefire Plugin will automatically include all test classes
  with the following wildcard patterns:

   * <"**/Test*.java"> - includes all of its subdirectories and all java
   filenames that start with "Test".

   * <"**/*Test.java"> - includes all of its subdirectories and all java
   filenames that end with "Test".

   * <"**/*TestCase.java"> - includes all of its subdirectories and all java
   filenames that end with "TestCase".

   []

  If the test classes does not go with the naming convention, then configure
  Surefire Plugin and specify the tests you want to include.

* Exclusions

  There are certain times when some tests are causing the build to fail.
  Excluding them is one of the best workarounds to continue the build.
  Exclusions can be done by configuring the <<excludes>> property of the
  plugin.
