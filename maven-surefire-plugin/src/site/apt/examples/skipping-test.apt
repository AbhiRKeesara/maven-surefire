Skipping Tests

 To skip running the tests for a particular project, set the <<skipTests>>
 property to <<true>>.

+---+
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.4.2</version>
        <configuration>
          <skipTests>true</skipTests>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
+---+

 You can also skip the tests via command line by executing the following command:

+---+
mvn install -DskipTests
+---+

 If you absolutely must, you can also use the <<<maven.test.skip>>> property to skip compiling the tests.
 <<<maven.test.skip>>> is honored by Surefire and the Compiler Plugin.

+---+
mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
