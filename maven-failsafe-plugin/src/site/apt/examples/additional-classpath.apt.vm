Additional Classpath Elements

  If you need to put more stuff in your classpath when Surefire executes (e.g some funky resources or a container special jar),
  we normally recommend you add it to your classpath as a dependency.  Consider deploying shared jars to a private remote repository for your
  organization.
  
  But, if you must, you can use the <<<additionalClasspathElements>>> element to add custom resources/jars to your classpath.
  This will be treated as an absolute file system path, so you may want use ${basedir} or another property combined with a relative path.
  Note that additional classpath elements are added to the end of the classpath, so you cannot use these to 
  override project dependencies or resources.
