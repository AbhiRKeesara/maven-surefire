Running a Single Test

  During development, you may run a single test class repeatedly. To run this
  through Maven, set the <<<it.test>>> property to a specific test case.

+---+
mvn -Dit.test=ITCircle verify
+---+

  The value for the <<<it.test>>> parameter is the name of the test class (without the extension; we'll strip off the extension if you accidentally provide one).

  You may also use patterns to run a number of tests:

+---+
mvn -Dit.test=ITCi*le verify
+---+

  And you may use multiple names/patterns, separated by commas:

+---+
mvn -Dit.test=ITSquare,ITCi*le verify
+---+
